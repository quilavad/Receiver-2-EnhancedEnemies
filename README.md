The Threat has dreamt up some adjustments to our adversaries...

## Features

Receiver, we have received transmissions that the Threat has been modifying the behaviors of some killdrones. Reports include the following:

 - **Shotgun turrets**, that shoot multiple pellets per shot
 - **Sleeping killdrones**; behavior previously exhibited by only some grounded turrets now extend to ceiling turrets, drones, and security cameras
 - **Sleepy killdrones**; sleeping turrets, drones, and security cameras that go back to sleep after being awoken
 - **Security camera linked killdrones**; turrets and drones with destroyed cameras will still attack if a security camera can see you. Security cameras also alert if another security camera spots you

## Configuration
Some Receivers have also reported that they are able to exert some control over these new behaviors using the "**BepInEx Configuration File**" Mindtech. Reported changes include the following:

 - **Enabling/disabling** of individual new behaviors
 - **Likelihood of new behaviors** appearing
 - **Pellet count and spread** of shotgun turrets
 - **Wake up time** of sleeping killdrones
 - **Sleep timeout** of sleepy killdrones
