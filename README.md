The Threat has dreamt up some adjustments to our adversaries...

## Features
[Video Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLBAMNmnSIhEf-kTbC1i0FIyv4UXHCx9i)

Receiver, we have received transmissions that the Threat has been modifying the behaviors of some killdrones. Reports include the following:

 - **Lancer turrets**, that can penetrate any barrier and will sweep through cover (with bullets) after losing line of sight, with green camera lights
 - **Shotgun turrets**, that shoot multiple pellets per shot, with red camera lights
 - **Sleeping killdrones**, that start with their camera off; behavior previously exhibited by only some grounded turrets now extend to ceiling turrets, drones, and security cameras
 - **Sleepy killdrones**; sleeping turrets, drones, and security cameras that go back to sleep after being awoken, with black camera armor and sensors
 - **Security camera linked killdrones**; turrets and drones with destroyed cameras will still attack if a security camera can see you. Security cameras also alert if another security camera spots you

## Configuration
Some Receivers have also reported that they are able to exert some control over these new behaviors using the "**BepInEx Configuration File**" Mindtech. Reported changes include the following:

 - **Enabling/disabling** of individual new behaviors
 - **Likelihood of new behaviors** appearing
 - **Sweeping duration and speed** of lancer turrets
 - **Pellet count and spread** of shotgun turrets
 - **Fire rate and reaction speed** of shotgun and lancer turrets
 - **Color of camera lights** of shotgun and lancer turrets
 - **Color of componenets** of shotgun and lancer turrets and sleepy killdrones
 - **Wake up time** of sleeping killdrones
 - **Sleep timeout** of sleepy killdrones

 - masterchief00099 came up with the ideas for shotgun turrets and sleepy turrets
 - Bozocow came up with the idea of security camera linked turrets
 - Frisk, Joebama, and masterchief00099 came up with the ideas for lancer turrets
